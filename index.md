# Purpose

I'm confident in my self awareness, but I often find it unnecessarily difficult
to see myself from the first person. By "see myself," I mean answering why I do
the things I do, why I like the things I like, why do I know some things but not
other things, and many other "why"s. Suppose this task is difficult precisely
because it's done from the first person. Then, perhaps, I'll get different
results by seeing myself from the third person. Making a site to this end makes
sense to me.
