Sometimes, I find some very interesting words.

Ennui
: From Google Dictionary, "a feeling of listlessness and dissatisfaction arising
  from a lack of occupation or excitement."

Lacuna
: Pronounced "la-Q-na". Reminded me of "Hakuna Matata" from *The Lion King*. It
  means an unfilled space, interval, or gap. First seen in *I Am a Strange
  Loop*.
