Many questions need to be answered on a daily basis. Having most of them
answered beforehand saves time and needless effort. Some questions appear so
frequently that remembering the answer from last time is trivial. However, not
all questions are like that. There are many questions that appear frequently
enough that answering them from scratch takes a considerable amount of time, but
at the same time, not frequently enough to naturally remember the answers. For
these kinds of questions, documenting the solutions will probably save a lot of
time and needless effort. The frequency of encountering a particular question is
not the only thing that varies.

There are questions whose answers change. As new technologies and processes
become available, a solution that once worked for a question may become obsolete
in comparison to newer solutions. One of the main problems of new solutions is
that their adoption is slow. Given two solutions to the same question, people
will often choose the more familiar one until that one stops working. And it
might not ever stop working. If the solutions were laid side-by-side, the better
one should more immediately standout. A proper comparison of the two solutions
requires documentation of both.

There are also questions whose meanings change. The meaning of a question
definitely varies from person to person. It also varies from moment to
moment. This kind of variance is troublesome, because a close solution might not
be a solution at all. Fortunately, the solution of a question helps inform the
meaning of the question. Knowing more about the meaning of a question makes the
wording of the question easier to adjust, which hopefully brings the desired
solution closer.

**Is carpet worth it?**

Carpet is an alternative to wood, tiled, and other hard surfaced floors. Unlike
other traditional floors, carpet is soft and textured. There are three reasons
why these properties may be desirable. First, it is easy on the legs. The
softness of the carpet absorbs a good amount of impact when walking.
Additionally, it is not too soft to lose balance. Second, carpet feels
interesting to walk on. Carpets come in many different textures that can be felt
either barefoot or through a pair of thin enough socks. ...

I can argue for carpet all I want, but as soon as I find tackless strips across
my thresholds is the moment I despise carpet. Just give me hard floors and rugs.
