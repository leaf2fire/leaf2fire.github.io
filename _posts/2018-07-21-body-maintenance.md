# Goals

I want to control my body. The ability to use your the exactly as the mind
imagined is invaluable. Of course, that is an extreme level of control that
isn't physically possible, but that is still something to strive for
nonetheless.

I want to be aware of my body. A lot of physical problems go unnoticed before
they become debilitating. Having good bodily awareness will allow me to address
many of these problems when they are still easy to solve.

Bodily awareness also includes being aware of my own limits. Identifying whether
my body can handle certain situations is key to maintaining high productivity
and preventing injuries.

# Focuses

## Cardio

AKA heart or cardiovascular training. This will allow us to improve our means of
transportation. Needless to say, getting the right resources to the right places
faster at roughly the same costs is always a good thing.

[This article][robertson] on long duration low intensity cardio by Mike
Robertson taught me that there is more than one type of cardio. It also made me
realize the importance of training for more than one type of cardio.

### Aerobic

Breathing should be relaxed, silent, slow, deep, and nasal. Talking and laughing
can be done without shortness of breath. When I refer to relaxed breathing, I am
referring to this.

### Anaerobic

Moderately high heart rate and deep breaths through the mouth probably means I'm
hitting or in the anaerobic zone.

### MAX

Max heart rate hit. Feels painful but at the same time surreal.

# Routines

## Routine A

**Sets** | **Reps** | **Exercise**
:---: | :---: | ---
3 | 40s | Dead hangs. (one arm hang, arch hangs, tucked front lever, etc.)
3 | 40s | One arm plank. (archer pushups?)
3 | 8 | Declined pike pushups.
3 | 6 | Pistol squats.
3 | 8 | Single legged deadlift. Isolate each movement.
3 | 12 | Reverse crunches. Straighten legs and hip as much as possible.
3 | 12 | Arch raises.

For any exercise, if fatigued or unable to keep pace, move to an easier
progression. These exercises are for building and maintaining strength.

## Routine B

**Time** | **Stretch**
--- | ---
2m | Inverted Shoulder Backbend
2m | Inverted Spine Backbend
2m | Rear Hand Clasp
2m | Lying Cross
2m | Wrist-Biceps Stretch
2m | Seiza + Reverse Prayer
2m | One-Leg Pike
2m | Kneeling Lunge
2m | Pancake
2m | Butterfly
2m | Calf Stretch

Alternate between bumps (~12 count) and holds (~12 seconds). For example, do
three pairs of bumps and holds and two more holds.

I should feel the stretch and be comfortable enough to hold it for an extended
period of time. The stretch shouldn't hurt.

## Daily Routine

Before doing any of the routines above, jump rope for 10 minutes. Aim to do it
nonstop and slow down if breathing isn't relaxed. Once I'm able to jump rope
nonstop with relaxed breathing, slowly increase duration (30 minute target) and
jump rate.

### Greasing the Groove

**Sets** | **Reps** | **Exercise**
:---: | :---: | ---
2 | 60s | Inversions. Hand stands, forearm stands, etc.
3 | 6 | Pullups. Work on L-sit variation.
3 | 20s | Tucked planche.
3 | 12 | Shoulder dislocates.
3 | 20s | L-sits.

Do these exercises with the aim to improve efficiency, form, and rep count.
