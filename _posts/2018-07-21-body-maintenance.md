# Balance

# Cardio

AKA heart or cardiovascular training. This will allow us to improve our means of
transportation.

**Aerobic**

Breathing should be relaxed, silent, slow, deep, and nasal. Talking and laughing
can be done without shortness of breath.

# Strength

**Daily**

**CSRR** | **Exercise**
:---: | ---
-/3/4/- | Pullups.
-/3/5/- | Pseudo-planche pushups. Get shoulders ahead of hands as much as possible. Ensure shoulder movement is strictly vertical.

Greasing the groove exercises I do every day to improve efficiency, form, and
rep count. Since I'm performing these daily, I skip over similar exercises in my
current routine below.

**Current Routine MWF**

**CSRR** | **Exercise**
:---: | ---
A/3/6/60s | Pistol squats.
B/3/8/60s | Single legged deadlift. Isolate movements.
B/3/12/60s | Assisted dips (parallettes). Elbows in. Waiting for dip bars.
C/3/8/60s | Declined pike pushups.
D/3/12/60s | Reverse crunches. Straighten legs and hip as much as possible.
D/3/8/60s | Arch raises.

For any exercise, if fatigued or unable to keep pace, move to an easier
progression. These exercises are for building and maintaining strength.
