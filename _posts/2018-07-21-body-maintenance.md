Maintaining and training a physical body is important, because that is the
medium which we experience the world. Here, I document my current methods for
maintaining and training my body.

# Strength

**Daily**

**CSRR** | **Exercise**
:---: | ---
-/3/3/- | Pullups.
-/3/5/- | Pseudo-planche pushups. Get shoulders ahead of hands as much as possible. Ensure shoulder movement is strictly vertical.

Greasing the groove exercises I do every day to improve efficiency, form, and
rep count. Since I'm performing these daily, I skip over similar exercises in my
current routine below.

**Current Routine MWF**

**CSRR** | **Exercise**
:---: | ---
A/3/6/60s | Pistol squats.
A/3/6/60s | (**Skip** GtG pullups.) Arch hangs. Hold at the top for 2s.
B/3/8/60s | Single legged deadlift. Isolate movements.
B/3/12/60s | Assisted dips (parallettes). Elbows in.
C/3/12/60s | (**Skip** GtG pushups.) Diamond pushups.
C/3/5/60s | One arm inclined rows.
D/3/12/60s | Reverse crunches. Straighten legs and back as much as possible.
D/3/8/60s | One arm plank. Lift opposite leg off ground for reps.
D/3/8/60s | Arch raises.

For any exercise, if fatigued or unable to keep pace, move to an easier
progression. These exercises are for building and maintaining strength.
