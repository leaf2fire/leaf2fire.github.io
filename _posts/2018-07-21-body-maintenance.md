Maintaining and training a physical body is important, because that is the
medium which we experience the world. Here, I document my current methods for
maintaining and training my body.

# Strength

**Current Routine MWF**

For any exercise, if fatigued or unable to keep pace, move to an easier
progression.

**CSRR** | **Exercise**
:---: | ---
A/3/6/60s | Pistol squats.
A/3/6/60s | Arch hangs. Hold at the top for 2s.
B/3/8/60s | Single legged deadlift. Isolate movements.
B/3/12/60s | Assisted dips (parallettes). Elbows in.
C/3/8/60s | Assisted pseudo-planche pushups (paralletes). Keep elbows on top of hands.
C/3/6/60s | Inclined rows.
D/3/12/60s | Reverse crunches. Straighten legs and back as much as possible.
D/3/8/60s | Copenhagen twist. Start with Copenhagen plank and twist to touch opposite elbow to ground and back to plank. Core should remain static.
D/3/8/60s | Arch raises.

**Daily**

Greasing the groove exercises I do every day.

For exercises that require max effort, the goal is to do the exercises without
exerting max effort. Since max effort or close to max effort is required to
perform these exercises, doing many of them in a short period of time risks
injury. Therefore, I chose to do them throughout the day with relatively low
reps.

On the other hand, for exercises that don't require max effort, the goal is to
increase rep count.
